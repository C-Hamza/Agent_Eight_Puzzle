# **Eight Puzzle Solution**  

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Eight Puzzle Problem**, a classic AI problem that requires rearranging tiles in a 3Ã—3 grid to reach a goal state. The solution utilizes heuristic search algorithms to efficiently solve the puzzle.  

## **Features**  
- Implements **heuristic functions**:  
  - **Manhattan Distance** (sum of the distances of tiles from their goal positions).  
  - **Misplaced Tiles** (counts the number of tiles that are not in their correct positions).  
- Uses **search algorithms** for finding an optimal solution:  
  - Likely includes **A* Search** or **Greedy Best-First Search**.  
- Provides an interactive way to test different heuristics and analyze performance.  

## **Requirements**  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy (if used for array operations)  

## **Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EightPuzzleSolution.git  
   ```  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```sh  
   jupyter notebook EightPuzzleSolution.ipynb  
   ```  
3. Run the cells to execute the puzzle-solving algorithms.  

## **Contributing**  
Feel free to fork this repository and improve the heuristic functions or implement additional search strategies.
